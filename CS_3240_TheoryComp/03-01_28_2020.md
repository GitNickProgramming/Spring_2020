### Agenda:
-
### Homework:
-  Read: Page 55, 57 try to convert to a DFA
---
## Regular Operations (pg. 59)
- Union, Concatenation, and star as defined for regular languages.
- What is the union of two regular languages?
    - All Stings from both language ("lumps them together in one language")
- What is the concatenation of two regular languages?
    - All strings whose first part comes from the first language and whose second part comes from the second language (order is important)
- What is the star of a regular language?
    - Zero or more strings from the language, concatenated together.
        - Epsilon, the empty string, is always in the star of a language
- Practice regular operations on these languages
    - All strings that...
        - Start with 'c'
        - Are two characters long
        - contain 'bb'
---
## Non-Deterministic FA (NFA)
- Remove the rule about how many edges for each character from each state.
    - can be no out edges or many out edges
    - Examples on pg. 48, 51, 52
- Formal Definition: pg. 53 & 54
    - N1 = (Q, Sigma, delta, q1, F)
- NFA -> DFA
