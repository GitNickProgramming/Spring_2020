## Homework:

## I. The Compilation Process
1. Source Program
    + Characters
2. Lexical Analyzer
    + Lexical Units
        + Symbol Table
3. Syntax Analyzer
    + Parse Tree
        + Symbol Table
4. Semantic Analyzer
    + Assembly code
    + Byte Code, etc.
5. Code Generator
    + Machine Code

---
## II. The Linking Process
- Prgrams depend heavily on low-level system calls 
- They also require other external programs from supporting libraries
- Those extra pieces of code need to be linked to the user program.
---
## III. The Interpretation Process
- Each statement is decoded while the program runs.
- The interpreter acts lie a virtual machine
- It runs 10 to 100 times slower compared to compilation.
---
## IV. The Hybrid Process
- The intermediate code (not the source code) is interpreted.
- In other words, the source code is partially compiled.
- The code generator is replaced by an interpreter.
#### Examples:
```
Perl, Java, Python, and Others...
```

## V. Formal Language Theory
- Alphabet:
    - A Finite set of symbols
    - We like to use sigma to represent alphabets. 
- Word:
    - A finite sequence of symbols from a given alphabet
    - If w is a word, |w| denotes its length
    - Epsilon denotes the empy symbol.
#### Example
```
SIGMA = {a, b}

    - a is a word from SIGMA and |a| = 1
    - ab is another word from SIGMA and |ab| = 2
    - bbbb is another word from SIGMA and |bbbb| = 4

Formal Language:
    - A set of words from an alphabet

    - SIGMA = {a, b}
    - L = {a, ab, bbbb} is a formal language from SIGMA
```
- Grammer:
    - G = (V, T, P, S), where:
        - V is a finite set of variables
        - T is a finite set of terminal symbols        
        - p is a finite set of production rules
        - S is the start variable
#### Example:
```
    G = (V, T, P, S)
    V = {S, D}
    T = {0, 1, 2, ..., 9}
    P = {S --> D, S --> DS, D --> 0|1|...|9}
```    
- Generated Language:
    - Given a grammar G, the generated language from G, denoted as L(G), is the set of all words that can be derived from S (start symbol) using only G's productions.
#### Example:
```
G = (V, T, P, S)
V = {S, D}
T = {0, 1, 2, ..., 9}
P = {S --> D, S --> DS, D --> 0|1|...|9}
L(G) = {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 00, 01, 02, 03, 04, 05, 06, 07, 08, 09, 10, 11, ...}
```
#### EXERCISE:
```
Change the productions of the given grammar in order to avoid generating numbers with zero on the left (most significant digit)

        G = (V, T, P, S)
        V = {S, D}
        T = {0, 1, 2, ..., 9}
        P = {S --> D, S --> D'S', D --> 0|1|...|9, D' --> 1|...|9, S' --> DS'|D}        
```
- Left Linear Grammar:
    - The left side has only 1 variable
    - G = (V, T, P, S)
    - A exists in V
    - B exists in V
    - w exists in T*
    - G is left linear if all productions P have the form:
        - A --> Bw | w
#### Example:
```
        G = (V, T, P, S)
        V = {S, A}
        T = {a, b}
        P = {S --> Aaa | Abb, A --> Aa | Ab | epsilon}
```
- Right Linear Grammar:
    - G = (V, T, P, S)
    - A exists in V, 
    - B exists in V
    - w exists in T*
    - G is right linear if all productions P have the form:
        - A --> wB | w
#### Example:
```
        G = (V, T, P, S)
        V = {S, A}
        T = {a, b}
        P = {S --> aS | bS | A, A --> aa | bb}
```
- Left and right linear grammars are equivalent
#### Example:
```
G = (V, T, P, S)    -->     G = (V, T, P, S)
V = {S, A}          -->     V = {S, A}
T = {a, b}          -->     T = {a, b}
P = {S --> Aaa | Abb, A --> Aa | Ab | epsilon}      -->     P = {S --> aS | bS | A, A --> aa | bb}
```

#### Example:
```
Find a left linear grammar that is equivalent to the right linear grammer below.
    G = {V, T, P, S}
    V = {s, A, B}
    T = {a, b}
    P = {S --> aA, A --> bB| epi, B --> aA}

Solution:
    G = {V, T, P, S}
    V = {S, A, B}
    T = {a, b}
    P = {S --> Aa, A --> Aab | epi
```

- Regular Grammar:
    - A left (or right) linear Grammar
    - If G is regular then we say that L(G) is regular.
