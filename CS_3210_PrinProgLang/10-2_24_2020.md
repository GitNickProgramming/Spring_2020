## I. Binding
- An association between an attribute and an entity
- Examples:
```
    Variable (entity) and its type (attribute)
    Variable (entity) and its value (attribute)
    symbol (entity) and its token value (attribute)
```
- It can take place at different moments:
    - Language design time
    - Language implementation time
    - compile time
    - link time
    - load time
    - run time

- Consider the C assignment statement:
    `count = count + 5`
    - The set of *possible* values of an `int` variable is bount at compiler design time (>= 16 bits)

- Consider a C int variable named count:
    `int count = 5;`
    - The *actual* range of possible values of an `int` variable is known at implementation time (e.g., 16 bits)

- Consider a C int variable named count:
    `int count = 5;``
    - The type assigned to variable count is known at compile time

- Consider a C int variable named count:
    `int count = 5;`
    - The actual value of variable count is bound at execution time with this statement

- Static Binding:
    - When it first occurs before run time begins and remains unchanged throughout program execution

- Dynamic Binding:
    - When it first occurs at run time or when it can be changed in the course of the program execution

- Type Binding
    - It relates to the bind of a variable (entity) to its type (attribute)
    - There has been a significant shift to languages that use dynamic type binding
    - Examples
        1. Python
        2. Ruby
        3. JavaScript
        4. PHP
    - Disadvantages of Dynamic Type Binding:
        - Reduce reliability
        - Cost of Implementation:
            - Impacts execution time
            - PLs are implemented using interpreters
            
- Storage Binding
    - It relates to the binding of a variable (entity) to its location in memory (attribute)
    - Also known as *allocation* (*deallocation* is the reverse unbind process)
    - *Lifetime* of a variable is the time during which the variable is bound to a specific memory location.
    - Static and Global Variables
        - Variables that are bound to memory cells before program execution begins, remaining to those same memory cells until program execution terminates.
        - Examples:
            - In Java you create static variables within a class prefixing them with the static keyword.
            
            - In Python, variables created outside any class or function are global and any variables created within a class (but outside any method) are considered static.
```
# global variable (statically allocated)
x = 10

def function():
    global x
    x += 1
    print("x = " + str(x))
    
# main
print("x = " + str(x))
function()
```

```
class A:
    x = 10
    
    def function(self):
        A.x += 1
        print("x = " + str(A.x))
        
# main
a = A()
print("x = " + str(A.x))
a.function()
```

```
public class example{
    private static int x = 10;
    
    private void function(int y) {
        System.out.println("y = " + y);
        x++;
        y++;
    }
    
    public static void main(String[] args){
        example ex = new Example();
        int z = x;
        ex.function(z);
        ex.function(z);
        System.out.println(x);
    }
}
```
- Stack-Dynamic Variables
    - Allocated from the run-time stack
    - Variables declare within a function
    - Pros and Cons?
```
public class Example{
    private static int x = 10;
    
    private void function(int y) {
        System.out.println("y = " + y);
        x++;
        y++;
    }
    
    public static void main (String[] args){
        Example ex = new Example();
        int z = x;
        ex.function(z);
        ex.function(z);
        System.out.println(x);
    }
}
```
- Explicit Heap-Dynamic Variables
    - Instance Variables explicitly allocated
    - Pros and Cons?
```
public class StudentDriver{
    
    public static void main(String[] args){
        Student st = new Student(1, "Ze");
    }
}

public class student {
    private int id;
    private String name;
    
    public Student(int id, String name){
        this.id = id;
        this.name = name;
    }
    
    public int getId(){ return id; }
    
    public String getname() { return name; }
    
}
```
- Implicit Heap-Dynamic Variables 
    - Instance variables implicitly allocated
    - Pros and Cons?
```
class Student:
    
    def __init__(self, id, name):
        self.id = id;
        self.name = name;
        
# main
s = Student(1, "Ze")
```
- Binding (summary)
    - Binding is the association of attributes
    - Knowledge of binding times of attributes is essential to understand the semantics of programming languages.

## II. Memory Segments
- A running program (process) is organized in memory by the OS into memory segments (regions)
- The text segment (aka code segment) contains the instructions of the running program.
- Statical and global variables are allocated in the data and the BSS segments.
- Uninitialized variables go to the BSS segment
- Dynamically allocated variables are stored in the heap memory segment.
- The heap (in most architectures) grows from lower to higher addresses
- The (call) stack (aka runtime stack) is used to store local variables along with information that is saved each time a function is called.
- The stack (in most architectures) grows from higher to lower addresses
- Every time there is a function call within a program a stack frame is pushed onto the call stack.
- Conversely, when the function execution ends, its associated stack frame is popped out.
- Stack frames contain local variables (the ones created inside the function), including function parameters and the *return address*
- The *return address* has the address of the next instruction to be called when the function terminates execution.
---
## III. Scope
- The scope of a variable determines if a variable is visible or not within different contexts
- A variable is said to be visible in a statement if it can be referenced (read) or assigned (written) in that statement
- Scope can be global, module, function, or block
- Most PLs allow variables to have global scope (when variable definitions can appear outside functions)
- Examples
    1. C
    2. C++
    3. PHP
    4. JavaScript
    5. Python
- Variables defined inside functions (or blocks) have local scope within them
- Sometimes a local variable may hide a global variable with the same name
- PLs can provide mechanisms for disambiguation (for example, `global` in Python or :: scope operator in C++)
```
# global variable (statically allocated)

x = 10

def function():
    global x
    x += 1
    print("x = " + str(x))
    
# main
print("x = " + str(x))
function()
```

- Blocks:
    - A block is a section of code
    - Most PLs are block-structured languages
    - Examples:
        - {} in C, C++, and Java
        - Tabs in Python
        - begin .. end in Pascal
- Nested Subprogram:
    - aka Nested function 
    - PLs may allow nested subprograms (i.e., defining a function within a function)
    - Examples:
        - Python
        - Ruby
        - PHP
        - Perl
        - Lua
        - Pascal
```
def function(x, y):
    
    def isEven(x):
        if x % 2 == 0:
            return True
        return False
    
    def isOdd(x):
        return not isEven(x)
    
    if isEven(x) and isOdd(y):
        return x + y
    return x - y
    
# main
print (function(2, 3))

```
- Static Scope:
    - Scope is known at compilation time and it is determined based on the block where the variable is defined
    - it is simple to implement, reliable, and efficient
    - List each visible variable to each of the four marked points
```
void fun(void){
    int a, b, c; /* definition 1 */
    ...
    while(...){
        int b, c, d; /* definition 2 */
        ... <--- 1
    }
    while (...){
        int c, d, e; /* definition 3 */
        ... <--  2
    }
    ... <--- 3
}
```

- Dynamic Scope:
    - Search for local declarations first
    - if that fails, continue looking for the dynamic calling parent o the parent, until a declaration is found
    - it is based on the calling sequence of subprograms, not on their spatial relationship to each other
    - The scope can only be determined at run time
    - It provides more flexibility, at the expense of reliability, readability, and efficiency
