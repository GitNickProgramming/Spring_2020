### Agenda:
- Quiz Questions
- Recap last class (Haskell)
### Homework:
- Finish Project 1
---
## I. Currying Interpretation:
- `add` is a function that takes **ONE** `Integer` argument and returns a function that also take another `Integer` argument and returns the final result of the operation
- This process can be generalized having functions taking multiple arguments, one at a time.
## II. Haskell I/O Functions
- I/O in Haskell can be understood as actions happening in sequence 
- Haskell defines a special type called `IO` that encapsulates interactions with the outside world.
- An I/O action is something that, when performed, will carry out an action with a side-effect
- I/O actions may contain some return value
- Writing Output:
    - `putStr`
        - takes a given string and forwards it to the standard output
    - `putStrLn`
        - takes a given string and forwards it to the standard output, adding a new line at the end.
    - `getLine`
        - Reads a line of text from the standard input and returns a string which is the line just read.
    - `main`
        - main is the default I/O program in Haskell, defined as:
```haskell=
putStr :: String -> IO ()
putStrLn :: String -> IO ()
getLine :: IO String
main :: IO ()

main = do
    putStr "Hello World!"
-- <- means single assignment operatior 
main = do
    putStr "What's your name? "
    name <- getLine
    putStr("Nice to meet you " ++ name)

-- Alternative Syntax w/ {} 
main = do {
  putStr "What's your name? ";
  name <- getLine;
  putStr ("Nice to meet you " ++ name);
}
```
## III. Haskell Lists
- A colleciton of items from a given type
- For every type T there is a list type `[T]`
- Examples of Lists:
```haskell=
[1, 2, 3, 4, 1, 4] :: [Int]
[True] :: [Bool]
```
- List Notation, such as [1, 2, 3], is in fact an abbreviation for a more basic form
```haskell=
1:2:3:[]
```
- The operator `:`, pronounced 'cons', is a constructor for lists
- Lists can be infinite
- Enumerations are not restricted to integers
- List Comprehension:
    - Describes a notation of a list in terms of the elements of another list.
