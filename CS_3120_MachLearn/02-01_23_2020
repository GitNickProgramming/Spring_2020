I. Machine Learning
    a. Artificial Intelligence >> Machine Learning >> Deep Learning 
        ~ Deep Learning refers to nerual networks
    b. We try to write programs that let the model or robot to 'learn'
    c. Different Types on Inputs:
        1. Speech Recognition
        2. Image Recognition
        3. Playing Go
        4. Dialogue System
    d. Machine Learning needs to be designed with a function in mind.
    e. Machine Learning Framework:
        ~ Input, Output
        ~ Function(<input>) = <output>
        ~ Error
        ~ Time
    f. Evaluate The model
        ~ Based on a set of functions, evaluate the goodness of function 'f' 
        based on training data.
    g. Steps:
        1. Define a set of functions 
        2. Goodness of those functions 
        3. Pick the best function 
    h. Supervised Learning:
        ~ The taining data you feed to the algorithm includes the desired
        solutions, called LABELS 
    i. Unsupervised Learning:
        ~ As you might guess, the taining data is unlabeled
    j. Regression:
        ~ Statistical approach to find relationship between variables.
        ~ In machine learning, this is used to predict the outcome of an event
        based on the relationship between variables obtained from the data-set.
        ~ Linear Regression is one type regression used in Machine Learning.
    k. Classification:
        ~ The problem of identifying to which of a set of categories 
        (sub-populations) a new observation belongs, on the basis of a training 
        set of data containing observations (or instances) whose category
        membership is known.
        1. Binary Classification:
            + Input >> Function f >> Yes or No 
        2. Multi-class Classification:
            + Input >> Function f >> Class 1, Class 2, ..., Class N
    
II. Linear Regression
    a. Example:
        ~ Images of cell samples were take from tumors in patients before
        surgery.
        ~ Turmors were then excised through surgery.
        ~ Patients were followed to check if the cancer recurred, and how 
        many years they have maintained healthy after the cancer is removed.
    b. Terminologies:
        ~ Columns are called INPUT ATTRIBUES or VARIABLES or FEATURES
        ~ The outcome and time are TARGET VARIABLES or TARGETS or LABELS
        ~ Each row represents an example or instance or sample.
        ~ The Whole table is the dataset.
            + Training Dataset:
                * A subset of the dataset (i.e., examples) is used to develop
                a model to predict the targets.
            + Test Dataset:
                * Once we have our model, another subset of the dataset is 
                used to evaluate the performance of prediction.
            + Note: These two dataset must be disjoint.
        ~ The problem of predicting a discrete/categorical target (e.g., outcome)
        is called classification.
        ~ The problem of predicting a continuous valued target (e.g., Time) is
        called regression. 
        ~ The term REGRESSION was devised by Francis Galton in his article 
        Regression towards Medicrity in Hereditary Stature in 1886.
        ~ REGRESSION: 
            + Prediction of Continuous outcomes, which is also called regression
            analysis.
        ~ How many samples, how many attributes per sample?
            + 'm' samples and 'n' attributes per sample.
            + Let 'x' denote the space of input values.
            + Let 'y' denote the space of output values.
            + 'h' is called hypothesis
            + Supervised learning problems are categorized based on the type
            of 'y' (i.e., output values):
                * If 'y' = Real value, this problem is called REGRESSION.
                * If 'y' is a categorical variable (i.e., discrete set), the
                problem is called CLASSIFICATION. 
            + 'w' is called a parameter or WEIGHT 
        ~ Loss Function or Cost Function
            + Used to evaluate the error in your model's function
