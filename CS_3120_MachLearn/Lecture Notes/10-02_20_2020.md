## I. Logistic Regression:
- If the estimated probability is greater than 50%, then the model predicts that the instance belongs to that class (called the positive class, labeled "1"), or else it predicts that it does not (i.e., it belongs to the negative class, labeled "0").
- This makes it a binary classifier
## II. Estimating Probabilities
- Just like Linear Regression Model, a Logistic Regression model computes a weighted sum of the input features (plus a bias term), but instead of outputting the result directly like the Linear Regression Model does, it outputs the logistic of this result.
