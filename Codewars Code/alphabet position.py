Built-in Functions: 

    ord()
        Given a string representing one Unicode character, return an integer representing the Unicode code point of that character. For example, ord('a') returns the integer 97 and ord('â‚¬') (Euro sign) returns 8364. This is the inverse of chr().
    str.join(iterable)
        Return a string which is the concatenation of the strings in iterable. A TypeError will be raised if there are any non-string values in iterable, including bytes objects. The separator between elements is the string providing this method.
    .lower()
        Python string method lower() returns a copy of the string in which all case-based characters have been lowercased.
    .isalpha()
        Python string method isalpha() checks whether the string consists of alphabetic characters only.
        - Return Value:
            This method returns true if all characters in the string are alphabetic and there is at least one character, false otherwise.
